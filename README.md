# Discord Test Bot

A discord test bot used to test out architecture and implementing a discord bot.

## Getting started

To get started working with this project locally you need to have node installed on your system:

- [Nodejs@12](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.13.0/)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

## Running locally

   This variable should be from your discord api information

npm run dev
```

### Disclaimer

This test-bot was created to allow us to test the discord.js library and experiement with setting up our own Discord bot. Our intent is to help [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) set up a bot for their Discord server - however, the files in this repository are **NOT** associated with FreeCodeCamp in any way.
