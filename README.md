If you don't know what these softwares are, don't worry much. These are essential softwares required to contribute to open source projects.

## Running locally

To test and develop this bot, you have to run it locally. To run the bot locally you have to follow the following steps -

1. Open the folder of your cloned repo
2. Create a file in the folder called `.env` and add your [Discord bot token](#creating-a-discord-bot-token) like this:

```
TOKEN=replace-this-with-your-token
```

3. Open the terminal in that folder
4. Type the following command and hit enter:

```bash
npm i
```

5. Type the following command and hit enter:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Creating a Discord bot token

If you don't have a Discord bot token, you'll have to create one. To create a Discord bot token, follow these steps -

1. Go to the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) website and log in
2. Click on the "New Application" button
3. Enter a name
4. Then confirm the pop-up window by clicking the "Create" button. By now you will probably see a page like this:
   ![PNG - Created App Page](../media/create-app.png?raw=true)

5) Click on the `Bot` tab on the left pane
   ![PNG - 'Bot' Button In Left Pane](../media/create-bot-in-pane.png?raw=true)
6) Click the "Add Bot" button on the right and confirm the pop-up window by clicking "Yes, do it!". After doing so, you'll see a section similar to this one:
   ![PNG - Bot Created Successfully](../media/created-bot.png?raw=true)
7) Now pressing the "Copy" button will copy your `Token` to your clipboard.

...and that's it!

## Additional Information

This bot uses the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library to interact with the Discord API rather than directly doing so. You can check out the docs for the library [here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome).
