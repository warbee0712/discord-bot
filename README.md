# Discord Test Bot

A discord test bot used to test out architecture and implementing a discord bot.

## Getting started

To get started working with this project locally you need to have node installed on your system:

- [Nodejs@12](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.13.0/)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

## Running locally

1. Be sure to provide the `TOKEN` environment variable, otherwise the bot will throw an error.
   This variable should be from your discord api information
2. Run in dev mode with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
