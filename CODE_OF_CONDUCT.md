This means no harassment, no hate speech, no trolling/flaming, and no profanities. Act as though this is a professional environment, and you should conduct yourself as such.

## No spam

Please refrain from spamming issues, pull requests, or comments. Do not link to irrelevant or malicious pages, and do not create off-topic discussions.

## Malicious Code

Opening a PR that intentionally contains malicious code will result in being blocked from this repository.
